## Introduction
My wife and I play the lottery from time to time. But I always forget where to look for the results when the big day of the draw finally arrives. So I end up visiting random lottery websites and get burried with ads, cookie-, and newsletter-popups. That's why I decided to create my own little lottery library that is able to poll the current draws - because I will never forget how to open the bash ;-)
